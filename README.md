# project name: QUIGO

- Inspiration: very often we are brought to travel from one country to another or from one city to another. 
Very often when you buy a plane ticket you get 2 suitcases of 23kg, a small suitcase of 12kg and a handbag.  
The idea is to put some of this luggage on sale if you don't need it.

- Main goal: our application will allow to sell the luggage of the users.
